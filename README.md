Project has been tested to work on Android and iOS devices 

This app can:
1. Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
2. Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
3. The front of the card should display the question.
4. The back of the card should display the answer.
5. Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
6. Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.
